# Lab Report 5 - Common Mark Spec Test Comparrison

## Step 1 - Finding differences between implementations.
Firstly, in order to recognize any differences between my implemention and the 
implementation provided, I ran the following bash script, bash.sh.

```
for file in test-files/*.md;
do
    echo $file
    java MarkdownParse $file
done
```

The following parameters were also added onto the bashscript.
`bash script.sh > [repoNameHere].txt`
